## Splitter project using Machine Learning

Basic app that allows a user to take a photo of a receipt and use OCR to detect items names, quantities and prices. The user can then share this with others and they can select items to pay for or split with other users. App will update live using firebase database.

The splitter iOS app will eventually incorporate Machine Learning to find receipt totals, tax and individual item names including there quantity and price.
